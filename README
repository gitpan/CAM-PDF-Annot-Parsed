NAME
	CAM::PDF::Annot::Parsed - Pluggable parsing for PDF annotations

SYNOPSIS
	# Define a parsing interface for the annotations
	package MyYAMLTinyParser;
	use base qw(YAML::Tiny);
	# MUST DEFINE parse METHOD!! it takes as input the string contents
	#  of the pdf annotations and must spit out the inflated version of it
	sub parse { return shift->read_string( shift )->[0] }
	1;

	package main;
	my $pdf = CAM::PDF::Annot::Parsed->( 'file.pdf', 'MyYAMLTinyParser' );

	for my $parsed_annot ( @{$pdf->getParsedAnnots} ) {
		# Since I am using YAML::Tiny to parse it, each $parsed_annot
		#  is a YAML::Tiny object
		# if document has annotations with the mask:
		
		#author:
		#    name: Donato Azevedo
		#

		print $parsed_annot->[0]{author}{name}, "\n";
	}

DESCRIPTION

	This module provides a way to use a pluggable parser to process
	comments on annotations of PDF documents. Annotations are free
	text strings generally contained in pop ups for drawing markups
	of PDF documents.
